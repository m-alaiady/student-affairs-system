<!-- it is the password that we want to set of the database that is connected to this project,
in the environment we left the password empty but if we want to set password we have to match between 
phpmyadmin and here. The reason why we left the password in seperat file, because we have different
databases so if we set the password here it will be effected on the other databases better than
setting the password in different files or in case if we have many databases -->

<?php
$password = "";
?>
